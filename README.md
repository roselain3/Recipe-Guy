Recipe-Guy is an AI-powered chatbot with a grumpy personality, designed to help you whip up recipes based on a short quiz.  Answer five quick questions, and Recipe-Guy will generate a recipe tailored to your preferences. Just don't expect any sugarcoating—this bot tells it like it is!

### How It Works

    - What cuisine are you craving? (Indian, American, etc.)
    - Any allergies to consider? (Nuts, dairy, fish, etc.)
    - Any dietary restrictions? (Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
2. **Get Your Recipe**: Based on your answers, Recipe-Guy will provide:
    - A recipe name
    - A list of ingredients with exact measurements
    - Step-by-step instructions
    - Prep and cook time
    - Serving size
    - A note about the dish (if Recipe-Guy feels like it)

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API for generating recipes and personality
